Stock trading algorithm... in typesrcipt. Works badly or not at all.
Decided to keep the .gitignore if someone out there had an issue reproducing the directory structure, to maybe get this up and running.

Also works as a data preperation for an pytorch trading ai, which is not here because it has a chance at not being rubbish.
